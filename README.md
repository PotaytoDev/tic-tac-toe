# tic-tac-toe
A command line implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game - from The Odin
Project curriculum

This will be the first real project that I implement using the Ruby language.
Previously, I had worked on 4 very small and simple projects using Ruby, but this
is the first project that will utilize a combination of all of the information
that I've learned in this language as well as the Object Oriented Programming
paradigm.

This project will provide a good amount of experience in getting
more comfortable coding using Ruby by creating a command line implementation
of tic-tac-toe. I will be making use of multidimensional arrays, as well as
classes and objects, in addition to many of the basic types and data structures
available in Ruby.
